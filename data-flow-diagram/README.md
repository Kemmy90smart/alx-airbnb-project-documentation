# Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

This directory contains the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the Airbnb Clone project.  

The DFD illustrates how data moves through the system, covering:  
- **Users**: provide input data such as registration details, booking requests, and payments.  
- **Processes**: system operations like authentication, property management, booking handling, and payment processing.  
- **Data Stores**: such as user database, property database, and booking records.  
- **Outputs**: confirmations, receipts, and booking details to users.  

- **File:** `data-flow.png` â€“ exported diagram.
